    range: FoodPreparationState
    #Currently Maps to both PTFI: Specimen Preparation, and Specimen Preparation Method. Consider separating them like PTFI does. Former has options raw, processed, cooked, and unknown, latter is longer list of processing/cooking methods e.g., boiled

  measured_compound:
    description: A controlled vocabulary term representing an analyzed component from a primary_food_type food sampled.
  measured_compound_value: # https://github.com/linkml/linkml/issues/1421 for ideas on any_of to have multiple ranges or an enum to catch examples like <10 or BDL
    description: A float representing an individual instance of a measured food compound value from an individual primary_food_type sample.
    range: float
  measured_compound_unit: #TODO find a way to constrain these with valid UCUM codes perhaps enum or recomended LINKML units docs.
    description: A unit code representing the units of measurement in which a measured food compont value from a primary_food_type sample was sampled.
  measured_compound_denominator_value:
    description: A float representing the denominator value (or portion size) of a measured measured_compound, e.g., 100 (for portion of per 100g).
    range: float
  measured_compound_denominator_unit: # Constrain by UCUM unit types (default g)
    description: A unit code representing the denominator units of a measured measured_compound, e.g., g (for portion of per 100g).
  measured_compound_data_points_number: # TODO add default 1 perhaps with ifabsent
    description: An integer representing the number of individual samples that comprise a measured_compound sample. 1 if an individual sample >1 if an aggregation of samples.
    range: integer
  measured_compound_record_date: # Generic date for Last Updated situation with USDA, TODO will need separate analytical analysis, and sample preparation dates. #Also will want to constrain with regex pattern to ISO8601 datetime stamp
    description: A datetime value representing a known recorded date pertaining to an analyzed sample.
    comments: Allows for ambiguity of date record relative to measured_compound_analysis_date. Use this if a date for a record is know but it isn't specifically the date of analysis.
  measured_compound_analysis_date:
    description: A datetime value representing the date in which an measured_compound was analyzed.
    comments: Use this field if the exact date of analysis is know if there is date ambiguity use measured_compound_record_date.
  measured_compound_comment:
    description: A Comment relating to measured component.
  measured_compound_derivation_type: # TODO add enumeration (e.g, Analytical as default, Calculated, inferred/Estimated, Sourced from literature) see food_nutrient_derivation.csv. May want to make required #may want to have another source field for if the data was from literature or external source to say where it was from doi or name of institution perhaps?
  measured_compound_limit_of_quantitation:
    range: string
    description: A string representing the lowest analyte concentration likely to be reliably distinguished from the Limit of Blank (LoB) and at which detection is feasible. Where LoB is the highest apparent analyte concentration expected to be found when replicates of a blank sample containing no analyte are tested.
    comments: definition reference from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2556583/
  laboratory_sample_aggregation_minimum_measured_compound_value: #Could try to shorten name for these 3
